# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

perl-class-data-inheritable: Class::Data::Inheritable (perl module)
perl-class-data-inheritable:
perl-class-data-inheritable: Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class
perl-class-data-inheritable: data. That is, if you want to store something about your class as a
perl-class-data-inheritable: whole (instead of about a single object). This data is then
perl-class-data-inheritable: inherited by your subclasses and can be overriden.
